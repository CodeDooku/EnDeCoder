A: *get's a test-message with a secret*

B: *see's the message* "OMG what a super embarassing message about your friend... I'm gonna tell everyone about it!"

A: "Oh noooooo. Now people think I'm dumb and I can't keep a secret."

DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU

Use the Chuck Norris Encoder today!

This program encodes every latin text to a binary-code

BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE

Normal people use 0 and 1 for binary but Cuck Norris only uses 0

Let me explain:

first your test will be encoded to binary

after that we will use zeros to determine the following series of numbers

0 = next series of numbers will be 1

00 = next series of numbers will be 0

example:

latin symbol: C

binary code: 1000011

Chuck Norris binary code: 0 0 00 0000 0 00
